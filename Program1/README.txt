This program is designed to take an arbitrary amount of pairs of 
coordinate points (checking for an appropriate number of pairs) and 
produce the Euclidean distance between each. 

It will then find for the user the average Euclidean distance between 
all of the points and provide the logarithm base 2 of the average. 
Additionally, a graph representing the size of this logarithm will be 
printed out.

To compile this program, all you must do is type the following command:
	gcc Program1.c -o <name_of_executable> -lm -std=c99

To run the program you compiled, use the following command:
	./<name_of_executable>

Thank you for using this program.
