Lab 2

This program is designed to take in either user input or input from a file to have a starting point for a player on the board and moving
it in the direction provided until the edge of the board is reached. Finally, it prints out the board after each sample.

To compile this program, all you need to do is run:
	make

To clear out the products from the makefile, simply run:
	make clean

To run the program, simply execute the main function made by the makefile:
	./Lab2

If you want to redirect output to a separate file from the source file:
	./Lab2 <source file name> outputfile

Thank you for using this program
