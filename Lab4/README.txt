This program takes in an arbitrary number of lines of students and their 
grades. This program calculates their averages, and adds them to the 
binary search tree in the appropriate position, to the left if it is 
smaller, and to the right if the student ID is bigger. In the end, the 
students are printed from the tree.

To compile this program, all you need to do is run:
	make

To run the program, simply execute the main function made by the makefile 
with:
	./Lab4 <Number of Students>
and if you want to take in input or output, add on to that:
	<<Input File>> <Output File>

Thank you for using this program/
