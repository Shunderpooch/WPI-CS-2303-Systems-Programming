The program is ran by typing in ./Program4 < textfile.txt, where textfile.txt is the text that the user wishes to parse.
The program will then automatically run through each line and list a table of all of the words in the text in alphabetical order, giving a count of each word as well as the line numbers that each word appears on. Hyphenated words are counted as two words, and all other punctuation is trimmed off (besides apostrophes).
