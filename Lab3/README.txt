Lab 3, CS2303 C02
In this program, based on a command line argument at execution, for example:

	./Lab3 10

10 (or an arbitrary amount of lines) will be passed to the program, providing processIDs, arrival times, and how much time they
will take with the CPU to complete. Each will be added to the Linked List in order of their arrival times. Following this, the
first item off the list is removed and printed, then the same is done for the second, followed by a printing of the remaining
processes in the linked list.

To compile this program, simply run:
	make
from the Terminal on a Unix-based/like machine to compile, and execute with:
	./Lab3 <number of lines of input for the linkedlist>

Thank you for using this program.
